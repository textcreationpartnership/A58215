            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>A Real Vindication</hi> OF Dr. B— From the Base and Scandalous Affronts put upon him, in two late Scurrilous Pamphlets, Intituled, <hi>The last Words and Sayings of the true</hi> Protestant Elm-Board; <hi>Together with a true Relation of a Conference between Dr.</hi> B— <hi>and the said</hi> Board: And <hi>A sober Vindication of the Reverend Dr. and the harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> Board; <hi>lately clew'd together in a</hi> Prophane Pasquill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHat a degree of Atheism, Prophaneness, and Irreligion, are the Men of these licentious times arrived to! That they dare, not only in private, but even publickly and in Print, scandalize, vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and expose to the rash censure of every Individual person, the Learned Doctors, and Reverend Prelates of our Church, the Pillars and Susteiners of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion: Nay further to redicule <hi>Scripture Phrases</hi> and <hi>Sentences,</hi> use them in their common discourse, change and vary them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own private fancies and Imaginations: What the next step will be, let every impartial Man judge; certainly with the Heretick <hi>Salvetus</hi> even to deny that person by whose Inspiration those <hi>holy writs</hi> were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us. A sufficient proof of the most part of this charge, is very conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, in these two Scurrilous Pamphlets against that worthy Divine D. <hi>B</hi>— A Man that hath very well deserved of this ungrateful Nation: One that hath been very officious in his Calling, always administring Spiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation to his Christian Brethren, one that hath both writ and preach'd sufficiently for the strengthning of all weak in the Faith; one who is an Honest Man, a true Divine, and a good Christian; whom none but Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, Atheistical, or Popish persons can blame or quarrel with: little better can we judge that <hi>Profligate Varlet,</hi> the <hi>Prejudic'd Author</hi> of this <hi>Atheistical Libel</hi> to be. In the front we have <hi>A Relation of a Conference between Dr.</hi> B— &amp;c. And why a <hi>Relation of a Conference?</hi> Because forsooth there was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd not long since, a Book Intituled; <hi>A Relation of a Conference between Dr.</hi> Stillingfleet, <hi>Dr.</hi> Burnet, <hi>and some Gentlemen of the Church of</hi> Rome. It is an old saying and a true, <hi>Touch a gall'd Horse back, and he will winch:</hi> Which I guess is my Authors case. The Drs. having laid open the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Errours and Superstitions of his Mother Church: But to proceed, he tells you a Story of the Antient stock of this true <hi>Protestant</hi> Elm-board; A word I believe he hath a great Antipathy against, by reason he joyns it to so despicable a thing as an old rotten Elm-board. <hi>And chose rather to be Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr'd in</hi> Smithfield. A sport he greatly wishes for: Oh how it would delight him to see Martyrs once again tyed to the Stake, with Fire and Faggot, in that ancient <hi>Popish-Protestant-Slaughter-house.</hi> Now he is come as far as the Dr. <hi>Then the Reverend Scot Dr.</hi> B—</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:65296:2"/>
            <p>An Appellation though here put <hi>Irronically,</hi> may be fitter applyed to our Doctor, than any <hi>Monk, Fryer, Jesuit, Cardinal, or Pope of them all. So remarkable for disturbing the Sick.</hi> Now may we plainly see his Jesuitical Malice; he vexes, because the Doctor like a Deciple of Christ, visits the Sick Persons before their departure out of this World, fitting them for a better. <hi>The Salamanca Doctor was design'd to be sent for.</hi> A great Eye-sore to the <hi>Papists:</hi> by reason of his discovery of their Hellish D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>signs, whilst at <hi>Room, Validolid,</hi> St. <hi>Omers, Salamanca,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But Doctor</hi> B—'s <hi>visit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it, who upon his first entrance saluted the</hi> Board <hi>with a Holy Kiss;</hi> not on his Toe, I hope: and said, <hi>Be of good comfort, my Brother suffer patiently, your Reward is great, thou shalt be the</hi> Royal-Oak <hi>in Paradise: and when thou shalt have left off this</hi> Touch-wood <hi>Tabernacle, thou shalt be as one of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars of Lebanon,</hi> &amp;c. What profaner speech than this, could even <hi>Hobbs</hi> himself feign'd or compos'd? O the Male volence of Atheism and Profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness! But to descant upon the words <hi>Royal-Oak:</hi> why <hi>Oak?</hi> because you are speaking of an <hi>Elm-board;</hi> Oh the sottishness and stupidity that Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Malice hurries a man into! Again, <hi>The Doctor being a Profest Enemy to all Ceremonies:</hi> how so I pray? I am sure he Conforms to the use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and necessary <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> Established by Law in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> To all <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> I must confess he is a Profest Enemy, not in the least ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of those innumerable and Superstitious <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in use in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church.</hi> As for his Queries, what things are more unlikely? is't then he makes the Doctor say, Doctor <hi>shall the Duke of</hi> M —<hi>be King?</hi> A thing he neither cares nor hopes for: Doctor, <hi>shall Scotch Kirk Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment e're prevail in England?</hi> What more improvable then this? for should that be, the Doctor would be in far worse case then he is; Doctor, <hi>shall we ever have a Parliament?</hi> Then which my Author f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ars and dreads nothing more. With three more Pallry Queries, not worth taking notice of, and altogether insignificant; till at last he makes the Doctor speak the truth, saying, <hi>Doctor you are a</hi> Papist, <hi>and so farewel, I will not absolve you;</hi> Not thinking he hath power to pardon any Man's Sin. Last of all, the <hi>Royal-Oak-Elm-board</hi> speaks. Board, <hi>Pray then Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, do not sham the World with a Narrative of my Life.</hi> Oh! how angry the Man is at the Doctor's Writing the Life of that Worthy Penitent, the E— of <hi>R</hi>—he is sorry that the World should know, how many and how great Sinners, our Church of <hi>England</hi> Divines, under God, can Convert; To the utter shame and disgrace of the <hi>Romish</hi> Doctors, who pervert more Proselites to Sin, then convert them from it. The other <hi>PAMPHLET,</hi> looking like a Puppy of the same Bitch; being nothing else, but as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, a continued <hi>LIBEL</hi> of Revilings and bitter Invectives, against the Doctor, 'twill be all together vain to answer it, being one and the same thing with the former: These I have run over (altogether without the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's knowledge) meerly for the undeceiving some of the credulous Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, who never yet heard of the Fame of this our learned, worthy and reverend Devine. And I heartily wish we had none amongst us inferiour to the Doctor: in Knowledge, Devinity, Doctrine, and good Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Then might we have abundant plenty of Good Writers, Good Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Good Livers: then would our Clergy in General be free from all As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persions and Calumnies whatsoever, except of Ignorant and Malicious Persons; which even the Holy Apostles themselves, were not free from.</p>
